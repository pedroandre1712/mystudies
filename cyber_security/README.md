Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio!</br>
 
In the annals of cybersecurity history, pivotal attacks have left indelible marks on the digital landscape. The LoveLetter virus of 2000 stands as a harbinger of modern cyber threats, exploiting email systems to spread rapidly and wreak havoc on unsuspecting users. Following suit, Stuxnet's emergence in 2010 unveiled the era of state-sponsored cyber warfare, targeting industrial control systems with unprecedented sophistication and precision. Furthermore, the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 caused global chaos, exploiting vulnerabilities in Windows systems to encrypt data and demand ransom payments. More recently, the SolarWinds supply chain attack of 2020 shook the cybersecurity world, infiltrating software updates to compromise thousands of organizations' networks. These attacks serve as stark reminders of the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, driving continuous innovation and resilience in cybersecurity defenses.</br>
