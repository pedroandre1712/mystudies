In the annals of cybersecurity history, pivotal attacks have left indelible marks on the digital landscape. The LoveLetter attack, also known as the ILOVEYOU virus, spread rapidly in 2000 via email attachments posing as love letters. It caused widespread damage by overwriting files and infecting millions of computers globally, highlighting the vulnerability of users to social engineering tactics.

Following suit, Stuxnet's emergence in 2010 unveiled the era of state-sponsored cyber warfare, targeting industrial control systems. The Stuxnet attack was a highly sophisticated cyber weapon designed to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. It exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows systems and targeted Siemens industrial control systems, specifically centrifuges used for uranium enrichment. Stuxnet's unprecedented level of complexity and precision marked a new era in state-sponsored cyber warfare, demonstrating the potential for malware to inflict physical damage on critical infrastructure. Its discovery sparked widespread concern over the vulnerability of industrial systems to cyber attacks and prompted heightened vigilance in cybersecurity efforts worldwide.

Furthermore, the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 caused global chaos, exploiting vulnerabilities in Windows systems to encrypt data and demand ransom payments. More recently, the SolarWinds supply chain attack of 2020 shook the cybersecurity world, infiltrating software updates to compromise thousands of organizations' networks. These attacks serve as stark reminders of the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, driving continuous innovation and resilience in cybersecurity defenses.</br>
